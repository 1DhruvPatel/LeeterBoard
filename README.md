## 🧠 Why LeeterBoard?
Competitive programming is one of the clearest ways to measure coding ability, yet there wasn’t a clean, centralized platform for universities to see how their students stack up.  
LeeterBoard fills that gap by offering a transparent, beautiful, and competitive environment for schools and students to monitor their performance over time.

## 📈 Future Roadmap
- Student Login + Personal Dashboards
- Notification System for Contest Results
- Global Rankings (Individual, not just University)
- Mobile App Companion
- Enhanced Data Visualizations (more historical trends)
